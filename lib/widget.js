This is a fork of widget.js (v1.0.0) created by Azendal (http://github.com/azendal)
Author: Ren√© Monroy
Description: Class library designed to create UI widgets easily. This version uses new Web API interfaces which means it doesn't depend on jQuery.
Dependencies: Neon Class System (http://github.com/azendal/neon)
Version: v0.1.0

--------------------------------------------------------------

Features of the widget system

* A custom and easy to handle event binding, dispatching and manipulation, with some sort of bubbling support
* A module system which we can use to include specific behaviour to any widget and reuse the code where needed
* A tree structure support for the widgets that the event system could bubble, and that also serves as
* A navigation system.
* The widgets must be able to be grouped to form more complex widgets
* Remove the complexity of DOM manipulation and handling
* A way to wrap widgets at our convenience to reuse widgets avaliable and make them comly to our needs
without the need to hack those widgets, that would force us to maintain the new versions of those widgets
and that is a very complex task when widgets become so complex.
* A widget system that would allow us to start wrapping some widgets for a fast start and later code our own widgets
at will.
* expose a consistent API that allow us to choose the use of widgets by API calls and user interaction at will and with the same
clearance and capacity
* an easy way to allow subclasing widgets
* an easy way to provide new html, class, and css for a specific instance of a widget that would remove us the need
to create complex inheritance structures that are hard to maintain.
