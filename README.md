Widget
====================

This is a fork of widget.js (v1.0.0) created by Azendal (http://github.com/azendal).

It is a Class library designed to create UI widgets easily. This version uses the new **Web API interfaces** which means it doesn't depend on jQuery or libraries for DOM manipulation.

It depends of Neon Class System with its Standard Library (8KB - http://github.com/azendal/neon) to build classes and that's it.
