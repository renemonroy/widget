Widget
====================

This is a fork of widget.js (v1.0.0) created by [Azendal](http://github.com/azendal).

It is a Class library designed to create UI widgets easily. This version uses some new [Web API interfaces](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) which means it doesn't depend on jQuery or libraries for DOM manipulation.

It depends of [Neon Class System with its Standard Library](http://github.com/azendal/neon) (8KB) to build classes and that's it.
