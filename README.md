Widget
====================

This is a fork of widget.js (v1.0.0) created by [Azendal](http://github.com/azendal).

It is a Class library designed to create UI widgets and views easily. This version uses some new [Web API interfaces](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) which means it doesn't depend on jQuery or libraries for DOM manipulation.

The idea behind this fork is to build interesting widgets by using latest technologies from JS, HTML5 and CSS3 only.

It depends of [Neon Class System](http://github.com/azendal/neon) with its Std Library (8kb in total) without Widget of course, and that's it.
