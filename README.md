Widget
====================

Class library designed to create UI widgets easily. This version uses new Web API interfaces which means it doesn't depend on jQuery or libraries for DOM manipulation.

It depends of Neon Class System with its Standard Library (8KB - http://github.com/azendal/neon) and this is actually a fork of widget.js (v1.0.0) created by Azendal (http://github.com/azendal) and weights only 2KB.

The possibilities to create any widget is infinite.
